To install as a system utility, as the root user, simply run: 
# python3 setup.py install --optimize=1

To create a packaged directory, run as your packaging user with the '--root'
argument.

As this is a noarch system utiltity, the setup.py install arguments --home,
--install-base, --install-data, --install-purelib, --install-platlib,
--install-scripts, and --prefix are explicitly disallowed.

While a development install is possible, symlinks are not created in the
OS paths.
